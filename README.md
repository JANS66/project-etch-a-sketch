Odin project etch a sketch

This one was harder one, because i have spent a bit of time on learning JS, so i had to remember CSS a bit, in fact how to make responsive grid, but after a bit of research i remember flex property, i never forgot it, i just forgot what properties to use to achieve desired result, then actually saw in the work how cool is flex basis, i figured out how to make desired grid, then after reading next tasks, i understood that they are not so detailed, even tho they were split in major steps, i had to split those problems even more, because grid size had to be interactive, default setting 16x16 but after user prompt i saw how cool is this when you have an responsive stuff, i can enter number, and responsively im changing css properties thanks to good js code structure and function calls and dom manipulation, so yea, it was so cool when i figured out how to make a grid from user input, 1x1 or 100x100 and all divs are exact same size. I enjoyed working on JS, had to remember css, also hardest part was to make them become darker, maybe because i was exhausted already, but somehow i managed to do it, feeling tired and exhausted, but its so nice that i can describe needed logic to achieve the task, last is converting english to code :D
